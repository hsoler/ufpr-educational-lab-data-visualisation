# ufpr-educational-lab-data-visualisation

This is is part of a college final essay for a course named "educational funding in Brazil". By adding it to my Github repositories, I only intend to be able to copy code from my main.py file in the future for other projects. Please disregard it. Thanks.

The original repository for this data can be found in https://dadoseducacionais.c3sl.ufpr.br/#/

PS: the "path" variable in main.py is set to my computer current address, if it is used as-is in a different environment, it probably won't work.
